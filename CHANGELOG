(Note to self: update freecode.com on new releases)

zrep 0.1: March 12,2012
	Initial release

zrep 0.2: March 15,2012
	Added better "are we REALLY master" check, for zone safety
	Added exclusion of mountpoint property, for initial sync copy

version 0.3: June 22, 2012
	Hacked in some support for Sol10u8 (and possibly better non-solaris
	system support, if you force "oldflag" to be true)

	Fixed bug in list_autosnaps
	Fixed issue with "zrep clear" deleting ALL snapshots instead of
	just zrep ones


version 0.3.1: june 25, 2012
	AAAAAA RE-FIX list_autosnaps bug!! prior fix made worse!
	Now tested better

version 0.3.2: june 26, 2012
	Old-system-support improved

version 0.4: june 28, 2012
	Only minor change for robustness, related to savecount,
	along with similar old-zfs-compat tweak
	But time to bump the minor version I think.

version 0.7: june 29, 2012
	Added some restructuring of internals. some added coments,
	a bit of standardization of function formatting, and addition of
	lastsynctime() function, so that should be able to have parallel
	operations safely soon!
	Plus added version number to usage message

version 0.7.1: July 5th, 2012
	Added check for volumes, to skip -x mountpoint


version 0.8.0:  (july 6th)
	Transitioned from very narrow backward ZFS compatibility, to a more
	autodetect generated methodology, that should be more portable.
	Plus improved comments here and there.
	A LOT of code change here.
	(But in theory, almost zero visible change to anyone who is current
	  with their ZFS)

	Changed 'status' output from "synced as of" to "last synced"

version 0.8.1: july 9th, 2012
	Arrg. Fixed it to work with solaris 11.
	Turns out they changed the output of zfs between 10 and 11.

version 0.8.2.: july 10th, 2012
	Found out I was not initializing dest volumes correctly,
	so fixed that.
	Also optimized regular dest fs initialization.

version 0.8.3: aug 16, 2012
	fix call to remotely set 'lastsent' property, for older
	zfs code. Was attempting to set on "$desthost" instead of "$destfs"

version 0.8.4:
	added support ZREP_CREATE_FLAGS env var, for "zrep init" use.

version 0.9: nov 8, 2012
	Added "snaponly", and "synconly" subcommands
