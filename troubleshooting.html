zrep is, by design, fairly simple. It is based around zfs properties.
Therefore, when in doubt, check the properties.
zrep gives an easy way to do this.
<P>

Here is an example of a set of properties for zrep replicating to a
filesystem on the same host:

<blockquote>
<pre>
# ./zrep list -v scratch/zreptest       
scratch/zreptest:
zrep:src-fs     scratch/zreptest
zrep:src-host   hamachi
zrep:dest-fs    scratch/zreptest_2
zrep:master     yes
zrep:savecount  5
zrep:dest-host  hamachi
</pre>
</blockquote>

For a destination filesystem, the properties would be mostly the same.
The only difference would be, instead of <code>"zrep:master  yes"</code>,
you would see
<code>"readonly        on"</code>

<h2> ZFS property overview</h2>


<h3> Fixing zfs properties</h3>
To manually change a zfs property, use
<blockquote>
<pre>
zfs set zrep:something=newval  file/system
</pre>
</blockquote>

To remove a property, zfs is a little odd. The standard (and in fact, only)
way of removing a property in zfs, is as follows:

<blockquote>
<pre>
zfs inherit zrep:master  file/system
</pre>
</blockquote

This tells zfs to set the value type of that property, to be "inherited"
from the parent filesystem. Since the parent usually does not have any
zrep properties, that effectively 'removes' a property from a filesystem or
snapshot.

<h3> Fixing snapshot properties</h3>
There is only one property that zrep currently cares about for
snapshots:<br>
<pre>
zrep:sent
</pre>
<p>
This contains a timestamp based value of the time it was successfully synced to
the target system.
Both the src snapshot, and the target-side snapshot, have this value, since
it is crucial in allowing smooth failover from src to test.

<h2> Bad status output</h2>
You will hopefully never see the following:
<pre>
# zrep status
scratch/zreptest                              synced as of [NEVER]
</pre>

If you do, it means that either there is no zrep snapshot present, or the
snapshot does not have the "zrep:sent" property. 
<P>
If there is no snapshot, then you will need to do a full reinitialization
of zrep sync and data, via
<pre>
zrep clear scratch/zreptest
zrep init scratch/zreptest desthost destfs
</pre>

<h3> Setting the zrep:sent property</h3>
If there IS a snapshot of the form @zrep-######, but zrep status is not
picking it up, then you will have to
manually set a "sent" property value.
The simplest and safest thing to do in this specific case, is to set it to "1",
via the following:
<pre>
zfs set zrep:sent=1 scratch/zreptest@zrep-######
</pre>

Presuming that "zrep list -v scratch/zreptest" shows the usual properties
(example at the top of this page),
you should then be able to once more do "zrep sync" for it.
<p>
<h2>Converting normal snapshot to a zrep snapshot</h2>

If for some reason, you have lost the "real" zrep snapshots, but have
a snapshot that you created by hand on the
master, and it also exists on the target, you should be able to rename the
snapshot on both sides to be "<code>zrep-000000</code>".
<p>
Once that is done, set the zrep:sent value <u>on the snapshot</u> (not
the filesystem) as mentioned above. You will also need to make sure there
is a "zrep:master" property set to "yes".
<p>
You may also need a lastsent property. See which properties zrep likes to
set on your version of zfs, by using "zrep list -v" on a working paired
filesystem.
<p>
You should then be able to once more do zrep sync again.
<p>
Do note that you cannot just randomly create snapshots on both sides for
this purpose.
The snapshot on the target side, must have been created as a result of a
zfs send/receive combination. That is the only way that zfs incremental
receives can function.
