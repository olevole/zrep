This is the home for "zrep", a ZFS based replication and failover solution.
It can also serve as the conduit to create a simple backup hub.

<h2> Downloads</h2>

<a href="zrep">Download zrep version 1.0.1 </a>, May, 2013
<p>
Alternatively, some older versions are still available:

<a href="zrep.0.8.4">zrep version 0.8.4 </a>, Oct 17th, 2012
<a href="zrep.0.7">zrep version 0.7 </a>, June 29th, 2012
<p>
Note that the download is not an archive, but a single 1000+ line
shellscript. Just chmod +x zrep, and you are ready to go!
<P>
The license for zrep is <a href="LICENSE.txt">available here</a>.
The short summary is that you are free to use it as much as you like,as
long as you dont sue me for anything that goes wrong :-)<br>

<h2>What is zrep?</h2>

Zrep is an enterprise-grade, single-program solution for handling
asynchronous, continuous replication of a zfs filesystem, to another
filesystem.  That filesystem can be on another machine, or on the same
machine.
<p>
It also handles 'failover', as simply as "zrep failover datapool/yourfs".
This will conveniently handle all the details of 
<ul>
<li>Making 'yourfs' be a data destination, rather than a source
<li>Making 'yourfs' be read-only
<li>Making the destination fs be "live", and ready to transfer data to
yourfs
</ul>

It also has user-friendly status outputs.
For example:
<pre>
# zrep status
scratch/datasrc                      synced as of Mon Mar 12 13:23 2012

</pre>

<p>
<a name=why></a>
<h2>Why use zrep over (z-other-thing)?</h2>

I originally looked around for a pre-existing program that safely handled replication
<b>and failover</b> of a zfs filesystem, but could not find one. Existing
programs all seem to be some form of glorified rsync. They are not
engineered to be run continuously, or safely. They often require a
considerable amount of knowlege for a sysadmin to configure them well.
<p>
In contrast, zrep is designed to be
<ol>
<li>Safe (has locking and other sanity checks)
<li>Easy to use
<li>Handles "failover" of active filesystem.
<li>Can be run frequently
</ol>

zrep can safely be run in a loop, thereby potentially generating
snap-and-replicate operations as frequently as 1-3 times a minute, and keep
going safely for many years.

<a name=overview></a>
<h2> Overview of use, aka Documentation</h2>

I have finally written a web friendly
<a href="zrep.documentation.html">zrep documentation page</a>

<p>
A super-trivialized version of how to use zrep, would be:
<blockquote>
<pre>
	zrep init pool/fs desthost destpool/fs
	# (will create the destination fs!)
	# Initialize additional fs's if you wish. Then..
	while true; do zrep sync all; done
</pre>
</blockquote>

After the initial full sync, this will do incremental zfs sends, back to
back, "forever". (or at least until you hit an error :)

<p>
For some amount of greater detail, please see the usage message, via 
"zrep -h"
<p>
The one "undocumented feature" you may care about, is that the property
zrep:savecount controls the number of recent snapshots preserved.
To change from the default (currently, 5), use
<pre>
zfs set zrep:savecount=NEWVAL your/fs/here
</pre>
<p>
There is also a separate <a href="troubleshooting.html">troubleshooting
page</a>

<a name=caution></a>
<h2> Caution</h2>
There is one thing to beware of: Don't try to use zrep on nested
filesystems. <br>
It's okay to use it on<br>
<pre>
/pool/fs/here
</pre>
Just don't try to use it on BOTH of
<pre>
/pool/fs/here
/pool/fs/here/too
</pre>

<a name=faster></a>
<h2> Faster initialization and throughput</h2>
If you are planning to do a lot of "initial syncs", and your data is very
large, you may be interested in looking at these patches to ssh.
They make it have larger sized TCP windows, and also allow you to disable
encyption on the transfer, if that helps you:<p>

<a href="http://www.psc.edu/networking/projects/hpn-ssh/">
http://www.psc.edu/networking/projects/hpn-ssh/</a><p>
<pre>
 Some speed results, from local-host testing:
  using regular scp to regular sshd, got about  20MB/sec 
  using regular scp to hpn-sshd, got about 30MB/sec
  using hpc-scp to hpn-sshd, got 150MB/sec
</pre>

<p>
Or, alternatively, you might want to just use rsh, if you blindly trust the
security of your network from sniffing, and you put some kind of firewall
or tcp wrappers around the listening demons (You can do this by setting
SSH=rsh in your environment).
It should be noted, however, that a zfs send has speed limits of its own,
so you may want to first time "zfs send your@snapshot >/dev/null", to see
if your gains are going to be significant.
Unless you're sending from an SSD, it is probably simplest to just stick
with SSH.

<h2> Source Code</h2>
zrep is a shellscript, so in essence, if you download it, you already have
"the source".  However, since it is a 
<a href="/solaris/ksh-largescale.html">large scale script</a>, I actually
'compile' it from multiple files, in a manner similar to other 
programming languages.
<br>
If you are a shellscript writer, this may interest you.
