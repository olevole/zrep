# convenience function to list only local filesystems for which we are

# pure "zfs get" implementation, but we also need to deal with the zone
# issue. When a single zfs filesystem is visible aross multiple zones,
# we dont want them all thinking they are master

# Usage:
# zrep_list [-v]
# zrep_list [-L]
# zrep_list [-v] fs1 fs2
# list all zrep-initialized filesystems (NOT snapshots..)
# If no specific fs listed, will show master, AND received filesystems,
#    unless -L given (in which case, only local masters will be shown)
#
# Normal output is one line per fs.
#
#  -v gives all properties of each filesystem
#  Give only one of -L or -v 
#
# This works because we only set this property on the actual fs.
# "source type" on snapshots for this property is "inherited" not local
#  or "received"
